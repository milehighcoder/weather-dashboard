# weather dashboard

## summary

This application was my first hands on experience implementing a Third Party API into an application that I created from scratch. I really enjoyed improving my skills in creating dynamic HTML. I used Bootstrap to design the UI. This was probably the most enjoyable aspect of this project. I thoroughly enjoy the design process in web development. I typically take a minimailistic approach in creating my UI and I feel that I did a pretty good job taking the data that was used in the API and arranging it in an aesthetically pleasing way while maintaining easy navigation.

## project description

Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. The challenge in this application is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

[OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) was used to retrieve weather data for cities. The documentation includes a section called "How to start" that provides basic setup and usage instructions. You will use `localStorage` to store any persistent data.

## user story

As a traveler:

I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities<br>
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly<br>
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs<br>
WHEN I search for a city<br>
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history<br>
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city<br>
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index<br>
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe<br>
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city<br>
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity<br>
WHEN I click on a city in the search history<br>
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city<br>
